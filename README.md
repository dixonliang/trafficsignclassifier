## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program

This was the third project of Udacity's Self Driving Car NanoDegree. The main objective was to create a neural network to classify German traffic signs using TensorFlow. In this respository, I have included my write up and the Jupyter Notebook with the raw code. My write up details my model as well as how it performed in classification.
